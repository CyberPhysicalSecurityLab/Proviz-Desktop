## What is Proviz?
Proviz is Internet of Things application development software. You can use Proviz to create Internet of Things applications without requiring any software or hardware experiences.

## That's awesome, but How?
Proviz has an easy-to-navigate graphical user interface GUI that allows a user to drag and drop the IoT board of their choosing on to a canvas. After dragging your board, you can easily configure and program your board.

When configuring your board, you tell Proviz the type of connection you are attempting to establish. Once you have configured your board, you can easily program it with our “Add Sensors” feature. Our application lets the user add sensors to the board by displaying a list of all possible sensors and allowing him or her to simply click the ones he or she desires. All the user needs to do is to establish certain boundaries using the Panther Language.
